# Ruby History

## Matz!

Note:
- Yukuhiro Matsumoto - nicknamed "Matz"
- Creator of Ruby
- Unlike many other languages you won't be able to go long in Ruby without hearing about Matz

<..>

## Timeline

* Earliest concept was in February of 1993 - Matz's response to Perl and Python
* First public release was in 1995
* Popular in Japan before US

<..>

## What popularized it here?

A little something called Rails <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note:
- this demo was revolutionary back in 2005 - everyone was talking about it
- web development largely changed after this

## What is Ruby used for?

| Good!            | Not so Good       |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Web applications | Performant work   |
| Automation       | Stats or Math     |
| CLI              | "Native" programs |

Note:
- Ruby is heavily used in web apps and in scripts
- It isn't the fastest language, so math-heavy apps or anything that needs to be fast won't typically use it
- "Native" apps are those that are compiled - Ruby just isn't that type of language

<..>

## So what type of language is Ruby?

* Scripting language
* Interpreted language (versus compiled)
* Dynamic language (versus static)

<..>

## Scripting Languages

* Ruby can be written standalone in a single text file
* Often includes a REPL
* Intended for automation, embedding functionality in another program, etc.

<..>

## Examples Include:

* DOS Batch (`.bat` files)
* SH files (`.sh` files)
* JavaScript (in your web browser)
* Perl, Python, PHP
* and more...

<..>

## Interpreted Languages

| Interpreted    | Compiled    |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Not standalone | Standalone  |
| Textual        | 01000101000 |
| JavaScript     | Web Browser |
| VBA            | Excel       |

<..>

## Examples Include:

* ... see the prior list of scripting languages
* Interpreted doesn't imply scripted and vice versa

<..>

## Dynamic languages

* We're talking about if the program can change while it is running or not
* Think about your browser again or maybe Excel compared to Email or Text/Word processing

Note:
- as I said, there is a big overlap between dynamic, interpreted and scripting languages
- the Venn diagram would mostly overlap
- Excel has macro support, meaning you can change behavior
